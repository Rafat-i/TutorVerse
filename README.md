## About The Project

> **TutorVerse** is an Android application designed to bridge the gap between students and tutors. It streamlines the entire tutoring process, from scheduling and booking to communication and feedback.

The app provides a dual-interface experience: Tutors can manage their business with color-coded schedules and availability tools, while students can easily find help, book sessions, and provide quality assurance through a rating system.
